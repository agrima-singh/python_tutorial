#Pyhton is a Dynamic Programming Language
#In python we can use single and double quotes for string but in java double quote is used for string and single is used for character.
#print() function
print("Hello")

# we can use "double quotes" inside 'single quotes' and 'single quotes' inside "double quotes"
# we can't use 'single quotes' inside 'single quotes' and "double quotes" inside "double quotes"
print("Hello 'Agrima Singh'")
print('Hello "Agrima Singh"')


# Escape Sequences
# \" , \' , \n , \t , \\ , \b
print("Hello \"Agrima SIngh\" ") 
print('Hello \'Agrima Singh\' ')
print("Hello \n Agrima Singh")      # new line
print("Hello \t Agrima Singh")      # tab
print("Hello \b Agrima Singh")      # backspace
print("Hello  Agrima\\")            # if we want to print single backslash

# Raw Strings
print(r"Hello \n Agrima Singh")     # by using r we can make it a normal string

# Calculator
print(2+3)     #addition
print(3-2)      #substraction
print(44*2)      # multiplication
print(4/2)        # float division
print(4//2)        #integer division
print(2**3)         #2^3
print(2**0.5)
#if we want to round a large value
print(round(2**0.5,4))       #it will print four values after point

#Precedence rule & Associativity rule
# () >> ** >> * >> \ >> \\ >> % >> + >> -

#Variables: Used to store data
number1=2
print(number1)
number2= number1 + 5
print(number2)

#variable naming rule
# 1. We can't start variable name with number but we can use it in iddle
# 2. We can start it with any letter and _ (underscore) 
# 3. We can't use special symbol while naming variable

#Naming comvertions
#user_name    (Snake Case Writting in Python)
#userName     (Camel Case Writting in Java)
